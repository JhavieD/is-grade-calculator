## Key Notes

### Role Overlaps
- **Ace** appears in both Sales Representative and Customer Support roles
- **Chaeng** appears in both Sales Manager and Marketing roles  
- **Kens** appears in both Sales Representative and Marketing roles

### Data Visibility Rules
1. **Sales Representatives** can only see their assigned leads/contacts
2. **Customer Support** can view customer profiles but cannot modify sales data
3. **Finance/Billing** has read-only access to sales pipeline
4. **Marketing** can import/manage leads but cannot assign them to sales teams
5. **External Users** have the most restricted access with limited CRM functions

### Security Considerations
- All roles except Administrator cannot modify system settings
- Financial data is restricted to Administrator and Finance/Billing only
- User management is exclusively for Administrators
- External users have no access to internal CRM functions or reports
